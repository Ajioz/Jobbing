We’re looking for an exceptional developer to continue building our front-end and work alongside our front end and full stack developers. This role is 100% remote but you will need to be available at least for a few hours in US Eastern or Pacific time zones every day during kick offs.\n\nClue uses data and AI to provide actionable insights that construction companies use to integrate, automate and optimize their operations.\n\nOur software is used by dozens of the US largest construction firms, we're growing rapidly, and we're backed by one of the world’s largest construction organizations.\n\nWe are now looking for an excellent React.JS developer to help us build our web console and platform. The ideal candidate is someone who is passionate about building reliable, performant and scalable website using React.js components.\n\nWe want an amazing React.js Developer to join our back-end development team\n\nYour mission is to …\n\n→ To build our front end web console, mostly in React. You will integrate our internal APIs use by our existing mobile and web apps.\n\n→ Work alongside our back end developers implementing algorithms, analyzing our clients’ telematics data to generate the relevant insights.\n\n→ Use a wide range of AWS services, including Lambda serverless instances, Redshift, and more.\n\nYou fit to us if …\n\n→ You have 3+ years of experience in React and Front-end development.

Construction is one of the world’s largest industries. 10% of the world’s GDP goes into construction.\n\nIt’s also one of the most inefficient industries in the world. While almost all other industries became more efficient, construction became more inefficient. Since 1945, US productivity in manufacturing, retail, and agriculture has grown by as much as 1,500 percent, but productivity in construction has barely increased at all.\n\nThis is about to change. Construction companies are finally waking up. They are spending more on IT than ever before. The amount of venture capital investment into construction startups jumped 4x in the last year alone, passing $2bn.\n\nTo sum it up: Construction is one of the world’s biggest and least efficient industries yet to be disrupted. It is an open field, a wide blue ocean for the best entrepreneurs, startups and investors. The time to get into this market is now.\n\nOur hiring process: simple and fast.\n\nPlease use the Apply function on our recruitment website and attach your CV. We typically give you our response within 48 hours. We prefer to have a video interview within a week after your application.\n\nLocation: Remote\n\nStart date: Immediate\n\nCompensation: The salary for this role is dependent on location and seniority.

No brain-busting coding or complicated database stuff here; just some basic content and links to other parts of the app.\n\nWhy You Should Jump In:\n\nClear Instructions: We've got a handy checklist of things that need doing, so you won't be left guessing.\n\nVideo Tour: To make sure you're in the loop, we've put together a video showing you what's what. Just shoot us a message, and we'll share it with you.\n\nTeam Player: We're all about talking things through and working together. Got questions or ideas? We're all ears!\n\nWhat We're Looking For:\n\nReact.js skills on point\n\nA knack for front-end development\n\nAn eye for detail\n\nGood at shooting the breeze\n\nBonus points if you've done bug fixing and added simple pages in React before\n\nWe're pretty pumped to find a React rockstar to help us level up our project.

We work hard, have fun, and are always improving. Because we're a small shop, you must be self-motivated, able to manage your day-to-day schedule, and a very good communicator. You'll have the opportunity to have your hands in everything, from the data model to stylesheets, from concepts to launches, from process to implementation.\n\nIf you have a passion to help the Church, and enjoy dreaming up smart ways to solve problems and then watching your code come to life to make a real difference in the world, keep reading.\n\nYOU'LL BE:\n• Working to build out a robust app suite for Flocknote using React Native.\n• Shaping the way people use Flocknote and the entire structure of our front end architecture.\n• Creating new features within the Flocknote web app and new React Native apps that are easy & fun to use.\n• Managing the technical aspects of Flocknote's front end. Including increasing client-side performance and accessibility.\n• Tackling bugs post-release.\n• Strategizing building out the right features for apps vs web.\n• Integrating new features into a non-react front-end codebase.

We won't be using class-based components at all.\n• To understand reducers, context, and state and the lifecycle of react components.\n• Taste! We don't pixel-perfect mock things up, so we'll be relying on some of your great ideas to make things easy to use.\n• To be a self-starter and a go-getter.\n• To have strong interpersonal skills and be flexible, detail-oriented, professional, easy to get along with, enthusiastic and of high moral character.\n\nBONUS POINTS\n• Any relative app design experience\n• UI transition and animation experience in React Native\n• Experience using Expo to build and deploy apps\n• Setting up apps to receive push notifications\n• Experience developing cross-client email design and understanding differences in HTML layout and compatibility issues for various email clients.\n• Experience with relational data models.\n\nAll positions are full-time (remote/work-from-home) positions with salary and benefits.",

Plus, I obtained both professional and financial growth thanks to the amazing clients they have. They really care about the entire developer experience.\" - Andrei Calazans\n\nAndrei's story is proof that vacancies you see at G2i are filled with healthy and fulfilled devs – which means this could not only be your next job, but the one after that as well.\n\nYou probably want to know what’s involved.\n\nIf you’ve been a Senior React Developer for years, you already know what it takes.\n\nIt’s all about delivering an amazing front-end experience. Keep your teammates happy. Keep the clients happy. All thanks to your production ready code, clear documentation, AND top notch communication skills.\n\nYou’ll work 100% remotely with US clients. Take your pick from the cutting-edge of FinTech and Crypto to those in traditional Food and Beverage industries, with plenty of choices in between. And since it’s a contracting position, once you finish a project you can easily move to the next one that floats your boat. We’ve got quite a few G2i alums who’ve stayed with us for several years doing just that.\n\nTeam sizes vary with each client but don’t worry, you’ll never be alone. We’ve got a really tight community of 800+ engineers on Slack that you can ask for help if you need it. You’ll also have a direct line to our Developer Success Team whose job is to have your back.\n\nTypical assignments are 32-40 hours per week, where you can bill up to $90 per hour. If you’re a stickler for detail, you might want to know that you’ll be working with technologies like React, Node.js, Typescript, Apollo, Next.js and popular deployment tools.\n\nG2i is the first hiring platform that focuses on developer health, which explains why we have plenty of opportunities for you to explore. We've seen burnout all too often in tech and we are on a mission to push back against it. We believe in maintaining a healthy work-life balance, and act on those beliefs by:\n• providing a 4-day (32-hour) work week\n• developing NFL-like support for burnout recovery, and\n• launching the Developer Health Fund\n\nNot to mention, we're literally writing the book on developer burnout prevention with our Restful Work OS.\n\nJust click “Apply Now”. We appreciate that your resume may not be up to date so just upload a PDF of your LinkedIn profile. You can then tell us everything else we need to know in a chat with the recruiting team and a technical interview with a fellow engineer.\n\nG2i is an equal opportunity employer. We’re dedicated to building a team where diversity in both ideas and identities is not only welcomed, but encouraged. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability, marital status, citizenship, national origin, genetic information, or any other characteristic protected by law.",
