Your job will be to develop the front end and integrate with the APIs.\n\nAs far as designs, we did designs in Figma, but then I changed the concept, and moved the elements around using Paint. So, you will have a jpeg, which shows the frame, and a Figma design, which provides the elements. There may be some missing pop-ups and minor stuff, so you have to be able to produce those based on the functionality, and using other pop-ups that we have for other parts of the system as a design reference.\n\nMore details, including Figma designs, will be provided to a shortlist of applicants. The final output must be 100% professional in terms of pixel perfect, smooth behavior, responsiveness, and everything. It is a single page, but it must be professionally done in every way.\n\nI would like to do this project on a FIXED RATE BASIS. So, please bid your hourly rate, but when you are done reviewing the scope, we need to agree on a fixed price and timeline.\n\nThank you.",
