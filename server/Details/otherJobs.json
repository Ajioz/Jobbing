In simpler words, we help start-ups, SMEs, and mid-size companies execute their software projects by either end-to-end solutioning or by providing them with the right talent.\n\nWhere are we based? Our HQ is Dallas, Tx and offshore center in India. We are supported by a network of talent from across the globe. Our 90% customers are in the USA.\n\nWhat is the problem we are trying to solve? 1-Entire operations being managed from India, including marketing; we lack the native touch in our messaging.\n\n2-Many hands have worked on our websites and campaigns. Currently, it's a beautiful( or ugly) mesh-up of things. Our website messaging is unclear and confusing for an outsider, too transactional, too technical, lacks a story, and lacks a real ‘WHY'.\n\n3-As a result, our demand-gen campaigns also lack uniqueness and appeal. Our story is missing in the newsletters.\n\nWhat do we need in this expert?\n• Someone who understands our world of software development ( not SaaS, Crypto etc).\n• Someone who Is technology savvy and understands how the world of software product development project management operates.\n• Someone who can narrate the challenges related to the above and create topics, stories, and newsletters around it.\n• Someone who can work with our CEO and curate the webinar, speeches and turn them into useful assets and storyboards.\n• Someone who has done brand communication management before\n• Someone who can add a human voice to technology subjects rather than just the technical ( and boring), ChatGPTish writing.\n• Someone who has experience in writing high-impact, result-driven, crisp email copies for demand-gen LinkedIn and email marketing campaign\n\nAbout BORDERLESSMIND\n\n“We believe talented digital workers are available globally, but the opportunities are not.”\n\nSince 1999, we have specialized in remote (offshore or nearshore) and onshore staff augmentation solutions. We have been a remote-first business a lot before it becomes cool to be one.\n\nWe help ambitious startups and enterprises build remote teams of employees from anywhere in the world, in any time zone.\n\nOur global team skillfully delivers solutions by modernizing Software development, optimizing Cloud infrastructure, leveraging Automation and through emerging technologies.\n\nWe take pride in sharing that the average tenure of employees at BorderlessMind is 5 years historically.
